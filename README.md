# Media Data Explorer: Movies and Web Series Analysis üé¨üìä

This project is a Python-based console application designed to analyze and visualize data for both **Movies** and **Web Series**. It uses the popular data science libraries **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to perform filtering, calculations, and generate insightful charts based on user selections.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

The application provides a menu-driven interface with the following key functionalities:

1.  **Media Selection:** Start by choosing between the **Movies** dataset and the **Web Series** dataset.
2.  **Search by Title:** Quickly retrieve all details for a specific movie or series.
3.  **Search by Genre (Top 5):** Find and visualize the **top 5 highest-rated** movies or series for any given genre using an interactive bar chart.
4.  **Search by Year:** List all media released in a specific year.
5.  **View Genre Statistics:** Generate comprehensive statistics and visualizations for the selected media type:
      * **Average Rating by Genre:** A bar chart showing the mean rating for each genre.
      * **Total Votes by Genre:** A bar chart showing the sum of votes for each genre, with the Y-axis and labels displayed clearly in **Millions (M)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

To run this project, you must have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the complete Python code (including the data strings, functions, and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block) into a file named `media_explorer.py`.

2.  **Run from Terminal:** Execute the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python media_explorer.py
    ```

3.  **Follow the Menus:**

      * The **Main Menu** will prompt you to choose between **Movies** or **Web Series**.
      * After selection, the **Operations Menu** will guide you through searching and viewing statistics for the chosen media type.

## üìä Technical Details

### Data Handling

  * The project loads two separate datasets (`movies_df` and `series_df`) from multi-line CSV strings using `io.StringIO` and `pd.read_csv()`.
  * A centralized `handle_media_operations(df, media_type)` function ensures that all searching and plotting logic is reused, making the code efficient.

### Visualizations and Formatting

  * **Subplots (`plt.subplots(1, 2)`):** Used to display the Average Rating and Total Votes charts side-by-side.
  * **Bar Labels:** Exact rating values (`9.3`) and vote counts (`2.8M`) are printed directly on top of the bars for clarity.
  * **Custom Axis Formatting:** Matplotlib's `FuncFormatter` is used to scale the Y-axis of the Total Votes plot, displaying large numbers in a human-readable **millions (M)** format.
  * **X-Axis Readability:** Genre labels are rotated 45 degrees (`axes[0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)`) to prevent overlapping, which is crucial with many genres.
  * **Seaborn Future Warning Fix:** Explicit use of `hue='Genre'` and `legend=False` in the bar plots resolves the Seaborn `FutureWarning`.
